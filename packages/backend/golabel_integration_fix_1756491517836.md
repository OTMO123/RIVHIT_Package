# GoLabel Integration Fix Summary

## Issue
GoLabel was crashing with "Unable to load file! There is an error in XML document (763, 3)"

## Root Cause
The FontCmd attribute in the generated XML contained embedded newline characters (\r\n) which broke the XML format.

## Fix Applied
1. Updated EzpxPrintJobGeneratorService:
   - Removed \r\n from FontCmd attributes
   - Removed leading newline from Description field
   
2. Files Modified:
   - src/services/golabel/generators/ezpx-printjob-generator.service.ts

## Verification
- Created test files that work correctly with GoLabel
- Confirmed PrintJob XML structure matches working Label_0.ezpx format

## Integration Ready
The GoLabel integration is now ready for production use.
